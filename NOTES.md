# Notes

## Assumptions
Any assumptions you made to solve this problem
    * Assumed Pay Period length from a given start date to the same date the following month (e.g. Feb 01 to March 01, or April 01 - May 01)

## Challenges
Any challenges and how you overcame them
    * No prior experience working with the React Context API, which was the biggest intial hurdle. Overcame this by following a youtube Tutorial of a very simple application that made use of the API in order to access and update data across many levels of a react hierarchy. Once I mastered how to use this tool at a very simple level, I was able to try implementing it in the coding challenge for Starlight. Then I just troubleshooted until I was able to make it work.
    * No prior experience with NextJS (in the past I've always relied on react router), but I found the documentation on this libary very adequate and I was able to implement NextJs in my app in very little time.
